# React TDD Katas

This repo provides [katas](https://medium.com/hackernoon/what-are-code-katas-and-why-should-we-care-2e3f1b7e111c) and solutions for practicing Test-Driven Development in the modern React ecosystem. 
To get up and running, `cd` into your directory of choice and follow the installation 

## Prerequisites

An introductory understanding of the [TDD Manifesto](https://tddmanifesto.com/) is required. I like [this quick explanation](https://youtu.be/u6QfIXgjwGQ), but a more [in-depth lecture](https://youtu.be/58jGpV2Cg50?t=1300) will help you get a lot more out of these katas.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cbouwense/react-tdd-katas.git
   ```
2. Open the first kata directory
   ```sh
   cd react-tdd-katas/katas/1-hello-world
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
4. Run the tests (it should fail!)
   ```
   npm t
   ```
5. Hack away!
